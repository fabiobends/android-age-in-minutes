# DOB (Date of Birth) in minutes

First project coded on "Complete Android 12 & Kotlin Development Masterclass"

I learned how to:

- use `LinearLayout` on column structure
- use `DatePickerDialog`
- set functions and values to XML contents using `findViewById`

Well, it started a "age in minutes", but it ended up as "age in days", this was simple challenge 😃.
